\title{Computes completeness values of the dataset}
\usage{
bdcomplete(indf, recs = 50, gridscale = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{indf}{input data frame containing biodiversity data set}

\item{recs}{minimum number of records per grid cell required to make the 
calculations. Default is 50. If there are too few records, the function 
throws an error.}

\item{gridscale}{plot the map grids at specific degree scale. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
data.frame with the columns \itemize{ \item "Cell_id" - id of the cell
 \item"nrec" - Number of records in the cell
 \item"Sobs" - Number of Observed species 
 \item"Sest" - Estimated number of species 
 \item"c" - Completeness ratio the cell
 
 Plots a graph of Number of species vs completeness }
}
\description{
Computes completeness values for each cell. Currently returns Chao2 index of 
species richness.
}
\details{
After dividing the extent of the dataset in cells (via the
\code{\link{getcellid}} function), the function calculates the Chao2 estimator
of species richness. Given the nature of the calculations, a minimum number of
records must be present on each cell to properly compute the index. If there
are too few records in the cells, the function is unable to finish, and it
throws an error.

This function produces a plot of number of species versus completeness index to
give an idea of output. The data frame  returned can be used to visualize the 
completeness of the data using \code{\link{mapgrid}} function with ptype as 
"complete".
