\title{Distribution graphs}
\usage{
distrigraph(indf, ptype = NA, cumulative = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{indf}{input data frame containing biodiversity data set}

\item{ptype}{Feature to represent. Accepted values are "species", "cell",
"efforts" and "effortspecies" (year)}

\item{cumulative}{with ptype as efforts, plot a cumulative records graph}

\item{...}{any additional parameters for the \code{\link{plot}} function.}
}
\value{
No return value, called for plotting the graphs
}
\description{
Build plots displaying distribution of biodiversity records among 
user-defined features.
}
\details{
The main use of this function is to create record histograms according to
different features of the data set. For example, one might want to see the 
evolution of records by year, or by species. This function enables easy 
access to such plots.
