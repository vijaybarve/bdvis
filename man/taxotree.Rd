\title{Treemap based on taxonomic hierarchy of records}
\usage{
taxotree(
  indf,
  n = 30,
  title = NA,
  legend = NA,
  sum1 = "Family",
  sum2 = "Genus"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{indf}{input data frame containing biodiversity data set}

\item{n}{maximum number of rectangles to be plotted in the treemap. Default is
30}

\item{title}{title for the tree. Default is "Records per <sum1>"}

\item{legend}{legend title. Default is "Number of <sum2>"}

\item{sum1}{Taxonomic level whose density will be represented with different 
cell sizes}

\item{sum2}{Taxonomic level whose density will be represented with a color 
gradient}

\description{
Draws a treemap (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping}) based on the
taxonomic information of the records.
}
\details{
This function builds a treemap of the taxonomic information present in the 
data set. It represents this information at two levels (with the arguments 
sum1 and sum2). The first level (sum1) will be represented with cell sizes and
is a reflection of the number of records in that group. If, for example, 
"Family" is selected as value for sum1, the size of the cells in the treemap 
will be directly proportional to the number of records for that taxonomic 
family. The second level (sum2) will be represented by color and is a 
reflection of the number of sub-groups in a particular cell. If, for example, 
"Genus" is selected as value for sum2, the color of the cell will depend on 
the number of different genera for that particular cell.
