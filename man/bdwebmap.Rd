\details{
In order to avoid cluttered maps and to improve function performance, 
certain limits are imposed on the number of species and records that can be 
visualized in a single map. Currently, maps won't work with datasets 
containing more than 30 different species and/or 1000 records. For those 
cases, we recommend subsetting the dataset and making more than one map.
